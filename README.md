## Future Plans

We have exciting plans to enhance uwuJobs in the future:

- **Job Rewards**: As you level up in each job, you'll have a better chance of receiving items when performing job-related tasks. Here's a sneak peek at what's coming:
  - **Miner**: Higher levels may grant you a chance to obtain ingots and precious ores while mining.
  - **Lumberjack**: Leveling up in this job will increase your odds of getting multiple types of wood when chopping trees.
  - **Farmer**: As your farming skills improve, you may harvest golden carrots and multiple crops at once.
  - **Shoveler**: Digging proficiency will grant you bonus items as you level up.
